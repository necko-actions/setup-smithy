# Setup Smithy CLI for GitHub Actions

This action provide the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

* Installing a version of Smithy CLI and adding it to the PATH
* Optionally caching the content of maven dependencies (located at `~/.m2/software/amazon/smithy`) specified in a `smithy-build.json`

## Basic usage

Running smithy CLI :

```yaml

  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: necko-actions/setup-smithy@v1
    with:
      version: "1.33.0"
  - run: smithy --version
```

Cache dependencies :

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
